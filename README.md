# Metro4_isolated
Metro 4 css isolated for use with Bootstrap

I wanted to use Metro 4 https://metroui.org.ua/ in my project which already used bootstrap. So I had certain pages sections where I would want to use Metro4 librabry alone.
So I tried isolating the Metro4 css so that it doesn't mess with the bootstrap css refered. I used a method similar to what is mentioned here using less to css conversion.
